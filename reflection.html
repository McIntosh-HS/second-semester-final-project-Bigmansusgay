I really enjoyed this class, I would easily recommend it to other students, as it also introduces AP for other people next year. Altough I won't be taking said AP next year since I maxed my AP's out with AP Lang APUSH and AP Env. I am very thankful for having this class to raise my GPA and morale, while also giving me time to sometimes work on other classes.

I never really understood how simple coding is to its core, as it really is nothing less than math. Simple equations that we use to find an outcome, which we can check by aplying its "math" to our project or in this case with HTML, our website. This really got me thinking outside of the box, which actually helped me think of chemistry much faster for my exam, allowing me to get a 92! It really amazes me how easy it is to apply yourself to something so simple and still have this much fun.

Patterns, everything has a pattern, even when it looke something a little like this "778&*SDDSY&*DY&*SDy78Sdn" it just looks like a bunch of randomness, but with a simple key we can use it to find what it was trying to say> If you did have the key, I said, Thanyou for your time. This is a simple example of how companies hide their code, by using a key and a random scramble. What's scary si that quantum computers can decipher them in seconds, vs today it would take an enormous amount of time to do, its amazing we can come so far with technology that the only thing stopping us from going further is defying pysics itself.

Minecraft coding was a very fun and inclusive topic we did. It really opened my eyes in figuring out how to creatively apply my code to what I do, making me think of ideas that I could use to create a real product. I mean seriously, making a working compute in a video game? Thats an amazing accompishment, which realy shows the lengths that coding has given us. In a way it gives me the idea of the 4th dimension, not literally but figuratively. Knowing that if I just go far enough, coding enough, I could make a completely working computer in Minecraft, I could play Minecraft inside of Minecraft. The assignments I had to do for this topic were fun, but sometimes they weren't easy but boy do I love tha challnge.
